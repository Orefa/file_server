I'm learning golang, and this is the first app I build, just for 
get inside the code...

This is a tool when i'm in some servers, that every time i miss.. 
Its simple, 

You fire, file_server and your current dir, starts being viewed by http, 
also, you can upload files to there

- Add some type of flahs session, to notify user after an upload
- Add the current path, and a direct acces to parent path
- Add file operations, like delete, move or uncompress zip files..
